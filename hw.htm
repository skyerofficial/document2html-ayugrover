        <b>Apple has released ten generations of iPhone models</b>, each accompanied by one of the ten major releases of the iOS operating system. It was followed by the 3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the<b> voice assistant Siri</b>. The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector. In 2013, Apple released the 5S with improved hardware and a fingerprint reader, and the lower-cost 5C, a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal.

        <p>  They were followed by the larger iPhone 6, with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays.</p>
        <p>The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year,</p>
        <p>which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs,</p>
        <p>as well as the SEâ€”which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S.</p>
